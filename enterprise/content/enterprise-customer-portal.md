This guide helps you navigate our Camunda Enterprise Customer Portal. This document includes information about how to gain access, download the license keys, create temporary license keys, and manage support contacts for our support JIRA.

Note that support will continue to be provided via our [JIRA support system](https://jira.camunda.com/projects/SUPPORT/queues).

**Disclaimer**: The Camunda Enterprise Portal is currently in closed beta. If you would like to join the beta users, contact your Customer Success Manager or email [customer-success@camunda.com](mailto:customer-success@camunda.com).

## How the Portal is organized

The Portal is divided into the following areas:

### Dashboard

This works as the home page of the Portal. In this area, you can:

- Check out important updates/news (e.g. new product releases).
- Find quick links to relevant areas/pages (e.g. JIRA, Manuals, Best Practices).
- Check pinned content.

### Content & Resources

This is the central repository for case studies, blog posts, demos, and other content. You can filter content using the top filters and pin content.

### Playbooks

This area includes compilations of resources available under **Content & Resources**.

### Training & Certification

This is an area with links to Camunda Academy, Custom Training Requests, and Open Trainings.

### Products & Best Practices

This is the section that links to Best Practices and Success Paths. Under this section, selected admin users from the customers (enabled by their Customer Success Manager) are able to access some additional areas, including the following:

- **Subscription Overview**: Admin users can find subscription information (e.g. SLA and SLA timezone), usage limits (e.g. PIs, DIs, TUs included), and support contact limits (e.g. number of full support contacts included).
- **License Key Manager**: This is where your companyâ€™s license key(s) are available to download. Additionally, admin users are able to create temporary license keys for development (valid for 90 days).
- **Support Contact Manager**: The page where the admin users can add, remove, and edit the support contacts who can access JIRA support.

## Who can have access

All support contacts at your company who have access to our [JIRA support system](https://jira.camunda.com/projects/SUPPORT/) have access.
